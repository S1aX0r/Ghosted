Welcome to Ghosted. If you're here, you're most likely worried about your personal privacy and how easily it can be searched up and used for malicious purposes. Hackers and scammers are not the only entities that are searching for your data. Depending on your threat model, three letter agencies such as the FBI, CIA, GRU or even other agencies that are unknown of, have an advantage in getting your information. Digital privacy, security, and anonymity will become more prominent in the future, so you may either take action now or suffer later. Enjoy Ghosted and please make sure to check up on Ghosted for information that will change. Remember to do your own research on your threat modek and when in doubt. Let's improve your PSA (Privacy, Security, and Anonymity)!

## PLEASE NOTE ##

# OPSEC (Operational Security) #

Your OPSEC is the most important factor that plays into security, privacy and anonymity. OPSEC is what this entire guide will cover, so it is important to remember key features that are discussed. So, let's start off with our first step to becoming a digital Ghost!

## ##

### BROWSERS & SEARCH ENGINES ###

Everyone uses browsers, whether it be on their phone, tablet, or computer. However not all browsers are the best when it comes to security or privacy. According to statcounter.com, Chrome is the most used browser, as 68.38% of people use it. While lots of commercials and advertisements push the security and privacy of Chrome it is owned by Google. Google collects an extreme amount of data about you such as location, phone calls, IP address, emails and can even remember all the times you said "Hey Google".

Shocking right....

However you can fight against the extreme tracking by completely changing your browser. 

### RECOMMENDED BROWSERS ###

### 1. Brave ### 

A open source Chromium based browser known for its out of the box hardened state. Brave has its own AI LLM called "Leo" that doesn't store any of your information or information related to you. Contains various security and privacy features, has adblocking by default, can hold crypto wallets and can route through Tor. 

### 2. Librewolf ###

Unlike Brave, Librewolf is a fork of Firefox known for being free and open source and hardened by default. Librewolf does all the security and hardening for you, unlike Firefox which needs to be hardened. Librewolf contains the Ublock Origin extension and has access to Firefox extensions, and can resist fingerprinting your browser. Various security and privacy features that can be customized to tailor certain needs, and comes preinstalled with private search engines. 

### 3. Mullvad Browser ###

Mullvad Broswer is based on Firefox that provides privacy features similar to the Tor browser. Much like the previous mentioned browsers it comes out of the box with hardened security features and paired well with a trusted VPN, fingerprinting will be a lot harder for companies and sites to identify you. Free and open source.

### 4. Tor Browser ###

The Tor browser is the go to if you want anonymity, security on a whole other level, and privacy from government agencies or privacy envasive entities. Known for being able to access the Tor (The Onion Router) network. While this is an excellent choice for P.S.A, it must be used correctly so that no information is traced back to you. Grants access to the "Dark Web" and built off of Firefox with access to extensions like NoScript which blocks JavaScript used to ID you. In addition to providing the best    P.S.A., it is also free and open source.

### 5. Firefox ###

Firefox is a free and open source browser that is private and secure. However it requires hardening in order to ensure its full potential. Lots of security and privacy featu### Inconclusion ###
res that can be tailored for various needs and has access to extensions to improve the security of the browser. Ublock Origin and Privacy Badger are recommended to install on Firefox.

### Inconclusion ###
There are plenty of other options that are avialable 
for browsers but these are the top five recommended. Keep in mind that different browsers can be used for various reasons and can fulfill different wishes. Do research on what browser suits your needs and make sure to verify that you have the correct browser installed. 

Now let's move on to the next part!


### SEARCH ENGINES ###

While the browser should be secure and privacy respecting, what search engine you use is also important. You may be familiar with Google or Duckduckgo and while Google does provide the best results in what you might be looking for. It is not privacy respecting. 

### RECOMMENDED SEARCH ENGINES ###

### 1. Brave Search ###

Installed by default with the Brave Browser, this search engine indexes its results, while utilizing its own search crawlers for results. Privacy respective but it is proprietary.

### 2. Startpage ###

A metasearch engine that comes preinstalled in Librewolf and Brave Browser that proxied Google as well as Bing results. Contains a feature called Anonymous View which allows the user to use a proxy that changes the IP, DNS, location and user agent to perform anonymous searches. While a very privacy respective search engine it is proprietary. 

### 3. Duckduckgo ###

Comes preinstalled on a variety of P.S.A focused browsers such as Tor, Librewolf, and Brave. A metasearch engine that contains Bing results but prioritizes user privacy.

### 4. Mullvad Leta ###

Installed on the Mullvad Browser by default that utilizes Google's API as a proxy to deliver Google search results. However to access this search engine an active Mullvad VPN subscription is needed.

### 5. Searx ###

Searx is a free and open-source metasearch engine. Aims for protecting the privacy of its users. Searx does not share users' IP addresses or search history with the search engines where it gathers results. Can be hosted on a server in the cloud and fully controlled by you.

### Inconclusion ###
While there are other search engines available such as Ecosia, the listed above pair well with the recommended browsers. 

If you are able to make it this far and implement a new browser and search engine, you have already done more than a majority of what people do for their P.S.A. So, let's go onto the next section!

## ##

### EMAILS ###

We all use email, and majority of the people use Gmail. Owned by Google and having the worst privacy you must ditch Gmail. Keep in mind other email services are not privacy respective such as Hotmail, Outlook, or other services.

The alternative is to use private emails. Let's look into better emails.

### RECOMMENDED EMAILS ###

### 1. Proton Mail ###

A FOSS and secure private email service that can be signed up for over Tor or a VPN. Proton Mail has a free tier and a paid tier with more features like greater storage. All emails are encrypted and can be encrypted when sending to non Proton emails. Available for iOS, Android, and Linux (recommended). Recommended to sign up for over the Tor network.

### 2. Tutanota ###

A free and open source email service that offers a free tier and asks for no information about the user. Tutanota is E2EE and has a sleek user interface for simplicity. Can be signed up for over Tor or VPN. Pairs well when signing up for Proton Mail. Recommended to sign up for this email first over the Tor network and then sign up for Proton Mail if desired.

### Inconclusion ###

Ditch Google and Outlook and switch to Proton and or Tutanota for better email privacy and security that offers end to end encryption for the sender and reciever.

Now that email is taken care of let's look into password security.

## ##

### PASSWORD MANAGERS ###

Here's one rule you should always follow and remember, NEVER STORE PASSWORDS IN A BROWSER! If your browser is ever compromised your passwords can be stolen and cookies can be used to log in to accounts without password authentication. 

There are multiple ways to store passwords, each come with their own pros and cons. While you can write your own passwords in a notebook and add special characters, numbers or words to add some form of encoding to the password itself. 

For example the password: "Password123" can be rewritten as:  "(P@$s_98w0rd!*7_456)" as a way of adding special characters and numbers to change the original password. Make sure to never reuse passwords as if one password is leaked then other accounts using the same password will be leaked as well.

If you don't want to write and make up your own passwords you can use a password manager. Simply put, a password manager stores all your passwords in a secure database that can be locally hosted on your computer. Often password managers require a master password which you should make them strong and complicated. Password managers will also create passwords that are very hard to guess or even crack if they are leaked. Often password managers will create a password that will take more than one million years to crack.

Let's take a look into password managers, shall we?

### RECOMMENDED PASSWORD MANAGERS ###

### 1. KeePassXC ###

KeePassXC is a free and open source password manager that can save usernames, passwords, URLs, attachments, and notes in an offline, encrypted file. KeePass databases can be stored in either an offline environment such as your computer or transfer to an external USB drive, or in a cloud based environment.


### 2. Proton Pass ###

Proton Pass is a free and open source secure password manager that comes from the Proton family. Proton Pass has a special email alias feature as well as a sleek user interface.

### 3. KWalletManager ###

KWalletManager is a Linux specific password manager that works on various desktop environments. Some Linux distrobutions come preinstalled with KWM. It is offline only and encrypts passwords. Free and open source.

### 4. Seahorse ###

Seahorse was developed by GNOME to store passwords and manage encryption 

### Inconclusion ###

Having a password manager is a no brainer. If you are worried about weak passwords that are easily guessed or don't want to write or make your own passwords, then these free and open source password managers will do the trick for you!

## ##

Let's cover what you should have now... If you are taking the necessary steps you should have a private and secure browser, search engine, private email, and a password manager. However we are not done! What happens if someone is able to get your password through social engineering or what if a company didn't take the necessary precautions when encrypting your passwords? This is where 2FA comes into play.

### 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ###

2FA or 2 factor authentication is an extra step that requires you to confirm that you and only you are the person signing into whatever account. Often a code is sent via SMS or emailed to verify the sign in. 

However SMS isn't secure as SMS is often unencrypted and texts can be intercepted by attackers. This is where 2FA comes in place. A TOTP (Time based One Time Password) is a password or code that has a small window of validility to ensure security that is sent to you via a 2FA application. Let's dive right into 2FA apps for better password security.

### RECOMMENDED 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ###

### 1. Ente Auth ###

A free and open source 2FA application that runs on desktop as well as iOS and Android. Ente Auth is an E2EE (end to end encryption) app, ensuring extra security is taken to prevent attackers from stealing TOTP codes. Includes secure online backups.

### 2. Aegis ###

A free and open source 2FA for Android phones that stores tokens in a encrypted vault with optional biometric unlock. 

### 3. Yubikey ###

A proprietary hardware version of a 2FA app. The Yubikey allows for users to plug the Yubikey into their device to allow a sign in. Lots of services such as Google accept Yubikey as a valid form of 2FA, however not every service does. It is best to pair a Yubikey with either Ente Auth or Aegis for sites that don't accept hardware 2FA.

### 4. Nitrokey ###

Much like the Yubikey the Nitrokey is another form of phycial 2FA. This free and open source 2FA hardware authenticator, provides varients of Nitrokeys and  has more private payment methods. 

### 5. SoloKeys ###

Another free and open source alternative to Nitrokey that is available to businesses and individuals. Provides affordable options with great security.

### Inconclusion ###

2FA is like adding another scoop of ice cream to the cone. The more security you have the better you will be. Whether you want to be private or not strong open source 2FA apps are needed, regardless of who you are. Now let's talk about encryption.

## ##

### ENCRYPTION ###

Everyone locks their doors to prevent someone from entering their home. Well would you allow someone to log into your computer and steal important and sensitive files? 

I wouldn't...

Encrypting your computer, handheld devices, USB's and SSD's is very important if you don't want anybody breaking into your computer and trying to steal bank records, tax info or even very sensitive data that is for your eyes only. So let's go into encrypting services to use.

### RECOMMENDED ENCRYPTION APPLICATIONS ###

### 1. Veracrypt ###

Veracrypt is a free and open source encryption application that allows a user to encrypt external storage devices as well as laptops and computers to ensure better security of their files. Available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

### 2. GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) ###

GPG is a more advanced form of encrypting your devices and files. While advanced and possibly intimidating for newer users, it does allow for more flexibility and cutomization. Free and open source and available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

### 3. AES-Crypt ###

This free and open source cross-platform per-file encryption app uses AES-256 cipher to encrypt files. Making it almost impossible to crack encryption. Available for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.

### 4. GoCryptfs ###

Free and open source encryption application for Linux and Mac, where each file is encrypted and stored seperately. Easy setup and operates within a command line interface. 

### 5. Cryptsetup ###

A free and open source Linux encryption application that can encrypt external hard drives and partitions of laptops and computers. Supports various encryptions like LUKS and AES.

### Inconclusion ###

If you want your devices to stay extra secure encrypting them is needed to ensure full security. Whatever situation you are in, whether it's letting a friend or family use your computer or you live in a place where crime is normal and you don't want thieves getting access to your files... Encrypt everything!

## ##

By now you should be feeling more secure, but Ghosted isn't just for security it is also for privacy and anonymity. The applications and tools listed are typically FOSS or Free and Open Source Software. This means the code is publicly available and community driven. This provides better security and trust within the FOSS community and its users. It is highly suggested that people make the switch from propietary software to FOSS. This not only supports the software but also the FOSS movement and can save you money and resources. There are also variations of proprietary software, services and apps that are FOSS! 

This next step in becoming Ghosted might be a bit difficult but if taken you will be way ahead of majority of the population. 

Let's go ahead and talk about Operating Systems or OS's.

### OPERATING SYSTEMS ###

Your OS plays a big role in your security, privacy and anonymity. Operating systems like Windows are the absolute worst when it comes to P.S.A. Windows should absolutely never be used if you care about your P.S.A! If you have to use a Windows based machine run it within the cloud or a virtual machine (VM). Windows collects way too much data such as your full name, location, records your screen, vulnerable to constant exploits that are often too late to be noticed. Windows also requires you to buy a product key and is owned by a non privacy respective company.

MacOS is more secure and private than Windows but is owned by Apple which has done shady things with user data. MacBooks are regarded as secure and private but there is one operating system that is better.

Linux or known by Linux nerds as GNU + Linux is a FOSS operating system that has an incredible amount of variations among its distrobutions known as distros. Linux is not only lightweight on resources and size it is also completely free and easy to install. Some distrobutions only require 500Mb of storage space and 500Mb of RAM! Linux is the best for a P.S.A operating system that doesn't collect any information on its users. Not only is it more lightweight, it also opens you up to a new world of operating systems that has come a long way and improved greatly. Even AAA games can run on Linux like Cyberpunk 2077! The best thing about FOSS and Linux is how it is your OS. You can do whatever you want with it, whether it be fully customizing the kernel and doing hardcore Linux programming, or simply "ricing" your OS to look a certain way. Whatever it is, it's yours! Remember to tape your laptops camera and mic for added security, there are also camera covers as well!
 
Here are the best operating systems for P.S.A

### RECOMMENDED OPERATING SYSTEMS ###

### 1. Linux Mint ###

Linux Mint is the easiest and most begineer friendly distro that works straight out of the box. Compatible with a grand majority of computers and laptops. Sporting a very customizeable desktop that allows for full customization and allows applications like Steam to play a majority of games from the Steam store. Linux Mint is a versatile OS that allows its users to fulfill their needs. With great security and privacy, Linux mint provides an incredibly versatile operating system, that does it all and is easy to use.

### 2. Fedora OS ###

Fedora comes out of the box with strong security and privacy by default (much like all distros) and is very versatile to fullfill user needs. A smooth sailing experience paired with great security and privacy just makes this distro an eye catcher.

### 3. TailsOS ###

Tails is a Debian Linux based operating system, that routes all its traffic through Tor and can be run from a 8Gb USB drive. When unplugged and signed out the OS forgets all information and wipes its history. If unplugged during user session the RAM of device is wiped and USB encrypts itself. Filled with privacy and anonymity tools, paired with great security, able to run from a USB and amnesic, makes this distro a go to for P.S.A.

### 4. Qubes ###

QubesOS is a security based operating system that provides security through isolation. Isolation is provided through the use of virtualization technology called Xen hypervisor. A "qube" is created and isolated from the OS to mitigate an attack surface. Has the ability to route through Tor using the Whonix qube. WARNING this is a very large OS. Recommended system requirements: 64 bit processor (hyper-virtualization enabled), 16GB RAM, 128 GB SSD. 

### 5. Whonix ###

Whonix offers both a virtual and live environment for anonymity. All traffic is routed through Tor and hardened for security and privacy.

### Inconclusion ###

Linux is the best to use for P.S.A especially the last three recommended distros. If you care about privacy get rid of Windows and MacOS and swap to GNU+Linux.

If you swapped to Linux then congrats! You are now a FOSS user who uses an amazing operating system. Keep in mind there are other distros that you can look into, like Debian or Arch. Now that your laptop or computer are using FOSS next we have to secure another piece of technology, your mobile device!

## ##

### SMARTPHONES & APPS ###

Your phone believe it or not is the biggest privacy envasive technology that is on you 24/7. Smartphones such as iPhone or Google made Android phones have the ability to track you without your knowledge. While Android and iPhone are closed source operating systems that collect and store your data, it is best to swap from these two proprietary OS's.

However if that is not possible then please lock down your Android phone and or iOS device for enhanced privacy. Disable all forms of tracking, do not give apps any sort of permissions and do not use an iCloud account or allow sensitive info to be stored in iCloud.

Same concept applies for Android but there are different options. Custom ROM's (Android Read Only Memory) are custom operating systems that can replace stock Android. These ROM's can provide far better security, and privacy and to an extent anonymity by utilizing FOSS tools and FOSS operating systems. So here are the ROM's that should be used.

### RECOMMENDED SMARTPHONE OPERATING SYSTEMS ###

### 1. GrapheneOS ###

A free and open source Android based operating system that offers high amounts of security and privacy. Graphene is a de-Googled phone meaning that Google has been removed from the operating system. However if you want to use Google apps and services, Graphene offers sandboxed Google play services. Only available for Google Pixel phones. Developed by a non-profit organization, 

### 2. CalyxOS ###

A FOSS Android OS developed by the Calyx Institute, that offers security, privacy and even anonymity based tools like the Tor browser and Orbot. Uses FOSS applications like messengers such as Signal and Briar, cloud storage apps like Nextcloud, and VPN's like Riseup VPN. Comes pre-installed with 18 FOSS and P.S.A respecting apps. Supports a variety of smartphones like Pixel phones and tablets, Fairphones, SHIFT phones, and MotoG.

### Inconclusion ###

While there are no iPhone alternatives for private operating systems, iPhone is a secure OS that can utilize FOSS apps that can provide an upper hand in privacy for Android.

Let's take a dive into P.S.A applications.

### RECOMMENDED APPS ###

### 1.Micro G ###

An open source alternative to Google Play Services. Apps and services will work as if they were on a stock Android but is more privacy respecting without any tracking from Google. Available on CalyxOS and GrapheneOS.

### 2. F-Droid ###

F-Droid is an app store alternative that catalogues FOSS applications for Android & ROM's. Functions like a typical app store that allows users to browse, install and manager FOSS apps installed. 

### 3. Aurora Store ###

Available via the F-Droid store, a FOSS client to Google Play that allows users to download, update, and search for apps without Google tracking.

### Inconclusion ###

These FOSS apps not only distribute more FOSS apps but also give great abilities like removing Google tracking when using Google Play Services.

However there is still more that we have to do. While you may be using FOSS operating systems and applications, there is still internet traffic that needs to be protected. In order to ensure that your internet traffic is secure, private and anonymized, proper and trusted services must be used. So what are we waiting for? Let's get into this.

## ##

### PRIVATE, SECURE AND ANONYMOUS TRAFFIC ###

This section will cover a large range of techniques and tools to secure and anonymize your traffic. VPN's DNS, messengers, cloud storage and other tools will be discussed. 

### VPN (VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS) ###

VPN's will not only encrypt your traffic but will also change you IP address from where you are located and change it to the servers that the VPN is running on. Please note that VPN's can act differently and can handle user data differently. It's recommended to use VPN's that are trusted, verified and do not collect or log any of your info. Some exceptions will be mentioned but are safe and secure over all. Let's check out some VPN'S!

### RECOMMENDED VPN'S ###

### 1. Mullvad VPN ###

The most FOSS transparent VPN service that doesn't require any user information, nor keep logs. No email, credit card, or phone number is needed. Account is made for you that isn't tied to you in any way. Offers multiple payment methods such as crypto and paying in cash. Safe, secure and with proper steps taken anonymous. A go to choice for users concerned about P.S.A.

### 2. IVPN ###

Similar to Mullvad as a FOSS VPN that allows payments via cryptocurrency and doesn't require any user information. No logging and another go to for P.S.A.

### 3. Proton VPN ###

A FOSS VPN and part of the Proton family this VPN should be signed up for over the Tor network. An email is required (see email section), as well as a password (see password section). Sign up with Tor for better privacy. Proton VPN offers a free tier for user who don't wish to pay. No logging and Switzerland based.

### 4. Windscribe ###

Another FOSS VPN that offers a free tier with strong encryption, multiple servers, and ad block.

### 5. OpenVPN & Wireguard ###

OpenVPN and Wireguard can be installed on Linux, Mac and Windows and is commonly installed on most Linux distros like Mint. These two VPN's are FOSS and allow a user to have more control over the settings when they are in use. The mentioned VPN's offer a OpenVPN configuration file which can be used instead of the application that comes with the VPN. Can also be used with servers in the cloud if you run your own VPN service.

### Inconclusion ###

VPN's are great but not all are created equally. The 5 mentioned above are great and should be used to ensure your internet traffic is secure, private and anonymous. If you wish to make your own VPN service in the cloud and disable all forms of traffic that is a more trusted VPN, as you are in control.

### DNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) ###

Your computer uses DNS to look up websites instead of looking up website names. For example 8.8.8.8 is what a computer would look at but we know it as Google.com. Your ISP or internet service provider can see what websites you go to, so having a private and secure DNS is an extra layer of privacy as well as security. So let's take a look into DNS's for your computers and browsers!

### RECOMMENDED DNS ###

### 1. NextDNS ###

NextDNS offers a free tier for users worried about their P.S.A, and is very customizeable for maximum control. Capable of running on browsers and opearting systems.

### 2. Mullvad DNS ###

Mullvad DNS is a free, encrypted and very private DNS that supports DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS. Able to run on browsers, operating systems and supports various blocking filters like ads, malware, trackers, adult websites, gambling websites and social media. No logging as well. This DNS provider does it all and is suited for users worried about their P.S.A.

### 3. Quad 9 ###

Quad 9 is a free DNS provider with an emphasis on security and privacy. No logging of users IP address's and is able to run on browsers and operating systems.

### Inconclusion ###

When not using a VPN (which has its own DNS), a secure and privacy focused DNS will protect your traffic from being snooped on by your ISP or external threats. It is another layer of security which is always beneficial for everyone and for every threat model.

### MESSENGERS ###

Your smartphone should not be using SMS aka the green bubbles. SMS texting is not secure nor encrypted and can be vulnerable to attacks. While iMessage for iOS does have security features, it lacks any form of privacy, and additonal security features.

So let's use more secure and privacy respective messengers for your daily communication needs.

### RECOMMENDED MESSENGERS ###

### 1. Briar ###

Briar is a FOSS end to end encrypted messenger that is decentralized. Briar can sync when WiFi, bluetooth
or memory cards to maintain the flow of info if the internet ever goes down. When connected to WiFi, Briar uses the Tor network for syncing and protecting the user from surveillance. Does not require a phone number nor any personal identification and all data is stored on device. Available for Android / Android ROM's, and desktops. 


### 2. Session ###

Session is a FOSS E2EE messaging app that minimises metadata (data that contains info for more data). No phone number nor email is needed to sign up, data is locally hosted on device, routes through Tor. Allows for voice messaging, and attachments. Decentralized and aims for P.S.A. Available for desktop, iOS, Android / Android ROM's. 

### 3. SimpleX ###

FOSS and E2EE that requires no form of identification. Decentralized proxy servers, and messages are relayed either through Tor or SimpleX servers for added security (via user's choice). Available for iOS, desktop, Android / Android ROM's

### 4. Signal ###

Signal has been praised for its security and privacy, however it is not anonymous. Signal does provide great security features for encrypted communications as well as routing calls through Signal owned proxies. Signal does require a phone number, so a phone number must be acquired anonymously. Usernames are a feauter of Signal which adds an extra sense of security and privacy. 


### Inconclusion ###

We all are either texting family, friends, co-workers or whoever. Messages can be intercepted if not using any form of encryption and can be tied back to you if they require personal information. The four included above excluding Signal are the best for P.S.A. Where as Signal is better for privacy and security.

### ALIASING ###

Never have the info come back to you... That can be very hard to do when there's already a ton of data that has been collected and is being collected of you. The best way to fight this is to use an alias to prevent data being relate to your ID. An alias service allows you to put in "fake info" that is securely and privately made, and routes the info provided through the alias to you. In short terms: it's a middle man. This will cover email, phone number, credit cards, and home addresses. Please be aware that there might be resources available but might not be privacy respective even if they offer a service that seems so.

Let's begin!

### RECOMMENDED ALIAS SERVICES ###

### 1. Addy.io ###

Also known as AnonAddy, this free and open source email alias service provides great security and privacy for protecting your emails. A free option is available that gives users 10 MB a month.

### 2. SimpleLogin ###

An FOSS email service that provides users with an easy experience and a free tier. Users can not only recieve but also send emails from their alias. Unlimited bandwidth more feautres coming soon such as phone number and credit card.

### 3. MySudo ###

MySudo is a paid proprietary phone number aliasing service that allows users depending on their plan to have one or nine alternate phone numbers. For maximum privacy a pre-paid Mint mobile SIM card should be used (purchased in either Monero, Zcash, or cash). MySudo offers a $1/month plan that gives one alias phone number, 3 email adresses, user handles, secure communications, 3 private browsers, and 3 virtual credit cards. Pay for MySudo services using virtual credit cards from Privacy.com, or through pre-paid credit cards like Visa gift cards.

### 4. Privacy.com ###

Privacy.com is a US only credit card aliasing service that hides users credit cards, often known as virtual credit cards. Offers a free tier and allows cards to be tailored for different services and hold big budgets.

### 5. Virtual Addressing ###

There are services like iPostal1, UK PostBox, and PostScanMail which provide a virtual address to hide your real home address. However they require lots of personal information and if necessary steps have been taken you can use these however be aware of the risks with using their services. Try as best as you can to give a real address that isn't related to or near you at all. If you are in the U.S and order something from Amazon, there are Amazon lockers where you can go an pick up your items. It's best to find a place that has a real address and send your mail there using faked information such as name, aliased email, phone number, and other info that is needed. Keep in mind this can be very difficult to do, or if you want send mail to a trusted friend or family member and pick it up from them. 

### Inconclusion ###

Good OPSEC includes data never being traced back to you, or mitigating as little of data being traced back or related to you. An alias can provide good security and privacy but be aware that aliasing your info is just a part of P.S.A.

Now, that aliasing has been covered we still have a lot more to cover, if you need to take a break and assess what you will and won't do. For higher security you must be committed and dedicated to not using anything Google or Meta related. More will be discussed about this...

Now, let's talk about cloud storage.

### CLOUD STORAGE ###

Everything nowadays has to be in the cloud... While that's not a bad thing and can provide better storage than keeping everything on a device or external SSD. There are often security flaws as well as large privacy issues such as who is maintaing your storage. While there are FOSS cloud providers, the best way of storing all of your sensitive files is to purchase external SSD's that range in the 1 to 2 terabytes of space. More is better if affordable. However if you can't afford external SSD's then the cloud can provide another option.

### RECOMMENDED CLOUD STORAGE

### 1. Nextcloud ###

Nextcloud is a FOSS self-hostible service that can hold all forms of documents, photos, contacts and much more. While this is not E2EE, precautions should be taken with Nextcloud. Prices may vary...

### 2. Proton Drive ###

A FOSS cloud service within the Proton family that offers a free tier with 5G of space. Protected with E2EE for users sensitive files. 

### 3. Cryptomator ###

While not a cloud provider, Cryptomator encrypts files and documents, then allows the users to send off encrypted sensitive data to cloud providers. 

### 4. Onionshare ###

OnionShare is an open-source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites and chat using the Tor network. Can be installed on all operating systems and is the best for sharing files due to the Tor network.

### 5. External Storage ###

Arguably the best choice for users serious about their P.S.A. No one to trust except yourself and your OPSEC. There are DIY options for hosting your own storage such as the Synology NAS. External hard drives and USB's are the best option that are encrypted and also hidden in either a safe or somewhere else where only you have the knowledge of its location.

### Inconclusion ###

Cloud storage is controversial among the tech and privacy community. If taken the proper steps having a private and secure cloud service provider to hold sensitve files can help with your P.S.A. However the best option is self hosting or external drives.

You might be wondering, where do I buy all these items and what should I use to buy them. Glad you asked because this is where crypto comes in. Crypto has been on the rise since the start of 2025. And using it to your advantage can give you the upper hand on improving your P.S.A. 

### CRYPTOCURRENCIES ###

Crypto is decentralized meaning that no one can control it. While it seems anonymous and can never be traced back to you, Bitcoin has a public blockchain that allows anyone to see who they got money from and where they are sending money too. Not the best for privacy... So here are some alternatives.


### RECOMMENDED CRYPTOCURRENCIES ###

### 1. Monero XMR ###

Monero (XMR) is a free and open source privacy based crypto with a strong emphasis on user privacy, full user control and high end security. A Monero node can be hosted locally on your computer or laptop or via a server that you control. Public nodes are availble however it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use them for privacy and security reasons. Monero features the ability to create multiple addresses for added anonymity, and comes with a modern GUI or works via a command line interface (CLI) for all operating systems. Monero nodes can run through the Tor network for added P.S.A and Monero nodes with Tor can be run locally as well. An absolute necessity for ghosts and cryptocurrencies. 

### 2. Zcash ###

Much like Monero Zcash (ZEC) is privacy and security focused that puts the user in complete control. Zcash offers encrypted transactions and hides wallet address. No publicly viewable record, free and open source and accepted in many retail places with the use of 3rd party apps. Zcash is an absolute power house.

### 3. Cake Wallet ###

Cake Wallet is a FOSS crypto wallet that can easily hold your Monero XMR. Available for all operating systems. that features no 3rd parties, full user control, built in exchange features, and has Cake Pay. Cake Pay allows a Cake Wallet user to live off their crypto for any type of spending needs.

### 4. Bisq ###

Bisq is a decentralized peer to peer, bitcoin exchange site. Offers a GUI to work from and is very simple to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies. Free and open source, privacy first, require zero forms of ID, and never holds your funds. 

### 5. Cryptwerk.com / Coincards.com ###

These two websites allow users to use their crypto currencies like Monero to buy whatever the user needs. Cryptwerk (recommended by the Monero team), has a Monero directory that allows users to buy everyday items like clothes, electronics, and even hotel and tour bookings. All businesses and services within Cryptwerk have a rating system that corresponds with the store and allows customers to leave a review. 

Coincards.com allows people to buy gift cards with crypto. Gift cards can range from retail, beauty, clothing, home improvement, groceries and even pre-paid credit cards. Coincards has it all and even allows users to buy gift cards worth up to $1,000. Privacy and security focused however it is proprietary, but offers a solution to living off crypto.

### Inconclusion ###

Cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash are perfect for being a ghost in the modern world. They can even be mined just like Bitcoin, however be aware of the cost that can have on you and utility bills. If you want to live off the crypto you trade, mine or invest in services like Cryptwerk and Coincards allow you to do so. And services like Bisq allow you to trade and sell you crypto to make profits.

### PHYSICAL SECURITY ###

Let's now go into physical security. You can be super secure, private and anonymous on the internet and digital world, but if you aren't in real life, then you are setting yourself up for disaster. This will cover physical OPSEC to ensure you have the best security in the real world. Let's get into it.

### PHYSICAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS ###

### 1, Clothing ###

You're clothing should not be flashy or eye catching in any way. Refrain from dressing up in neon colors, wearing t-shirts, hoodies, jackets or pants that have large custom designs that can attract unwanted attention, wearing flashy jewlery, or wearing clothing that seems out of place and causes people to stare. You should be trying to blend in with the crowd or seem invisible while in the crowd. Stick to neutral colors such as black, dark or light grey, white, brown, tan, dark green, and jeans. 

It is recommended to dress appropriately according to the weather. If it is Summer or Spring time, don't wear a hoodie or jacket, opt for something cool to prevent heat exhuastion like t-shirts and shorts. In the Winter and Fall where weather is cooler and strong winds can be prevelant. Wear hoodies and or jackets, gloves, hats, face masks like gaitor masks or clothed doctor masks, pants, and sneakers or boots.

For example this would be a great start for Winter or Fall:

-Black hoodie (no zipper, logo, or design)

-Black bomber or regular jacket (no logo or design), 

-Dark gray, green, tan, brown or black, fitted / slim (optional) cargo pants, joggers, sweatpants or jeans. 

-Dark colored beanie (no logo, design or pompom)

-Face mask (optional)

-Gloves

-Dark colored running sneakers or combat boots

-Backpack or bag (optional)

-Sunglasses (optional)

You can of course mix and match and add your own flavor this is just an example to seem low profile and hidden. 

Remember ALWAYS WEAR SNEAKERS!!!

Buy your clothes using cash, crypto, or gift cards privately or anonymously obtained. 

### Inconclusion ###

Wearing the right clothes that are not only comfortable and functional but also keep you blended into the crowd or hidden, will be best for you. Make sure to fit the crowd or learn to stay hidden in public places. Be wary of cameras that may record your face or eyes and take necessary precautions in where you are going and the general surveillance.
